### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying `.env.example`:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"  # SQLite for development
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"  # PostgreSQL for production

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# OAuth Providers (Optional)
# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"

# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_ID="your-github-client-id"
GITHUB_SECRET="your-github-client-secret"
```

**Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Use `.env.example` as a template.

### Database Setup
- **Development**: SQLite (automatically created)
